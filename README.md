# Disclaimers

This repository contains the result of work done from February through July of 2023 by Matheus Boger in the IMCN (Integrative Model-based Cognitive Neuroscience) research unit at the University of Amsterdam led by Birte Forstmann under the supervision of Niek Stevenson and Steven Miletic as a research intern as part of the coursework of the Brain and Cognitive Sciences Research Master at the University of Amsterdam.

Unless stated otherwise, all code regarding the volatile Kalman filter (VKF) was based on the mathematical definitions proposed by Piray and Daw, 2020 (full citation in text). 

The original data from Miletic et al., 2021 used in the analysis is available at: https://osf.io/txgb3 .

# Folder structure

In the root folder you can find this README and the final report itself. The rest is as follows:

- Data
    - Fitted models (RData files with the estimated parameters for each model and participant combination)
    - Simulated data (RData files with data generated for the profile plot, parameter recovery and simulation for the descriptive adequacy test for each model and participant combination)
    - Original data (empty; place here the original from Miletic et al., 2021 for the R scripts to work)
- Figures (all figures that went into the final report as separate files)
- R Scripts (R scripts developed as the final delivery of the internship)
